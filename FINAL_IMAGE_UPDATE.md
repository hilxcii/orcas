# Final Image Update - Orca Triad Website

## Completed: February 14, 2026

### What Changed

All images have been replaced with legally safe, professional alternatives that avoid any potential copyright or misrepresentation issues.

---

## Hero Section

**Previous**: Minimalist geometric window (10% opacity - too subtle)

**Updated**: California coastal cliffs - Big Sur Pacific Coast view with dramatic cliffs and blue ocean (35% opacity - much more visible)

This captures Sandra's love of oceans and California coastal aesthetic while maintaining the professional, elegant look.

## Project Images - Legally Safe Approach

All project images have been replaced with **generic cityscapes and abstract architecture** that cannot be mistaken for specific buildings or deals. This protects Sandra from any potential legal issues while maintaining a professional, high-quality appearance.

### 1. Brickell Luxury Residences
**Type**: Generic Miami aerial skyline
**Description**: Wide aerial view of Miami downtown - no specific buildings identifiable

### 2. Coral Gables Mixed-Use
**Type**: Abstract modern architecture
**Description**: Elegant curved architectural facade with flowing lines - purely aesthetic, no specific building

### 3. Fort Lauderdale Office Tower
**Type**: Abstract glass building pattern
**Description**: Modern glass window reflections and patterns - architectural detail shot

### 4. West Palm Industrial Portfolio
**Type**: Abstract architecture facade
**Description**: Contemporary building facade with geometric patterns

### 5. Miami Beach Hospitality
**Type**: Generic Miami Beach aerial

### 6. South Florida Multifamily Portfolio

4. **Stock photos** from legitimate sources with proper licensing
